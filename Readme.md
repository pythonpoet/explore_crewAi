# Crew ai exploration

This project is all about testing the features of crew ai aswell as starting a development trajcetory for the project. 

## How to 
1. First of all, make sure to be able to use git / github https://product.hubspot.com/blog/git-and-github-tutorial-for-beginners.
2. Follow install guide: https://github.com/joaomdmoura/CrewAI

3. create a key.py file and Generate openrouter.ai key: https://openrouter.ai/keys and insert it at "os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"]" in key.py file never push that to github!
(it is not openai but still works!)

4. run it and get familiar with it by playing with it (explore_crew.py uses ollama localhost, si_crew.py uses openrouter).

5. change a minor thing in the code and push it into github using the github instruction

## Development trajectory

- [ ]  Test it with fabric: 
https://github.com/danielmiessler/fabric 
This platform uses community moderated prompts that work best. 
This way we could implement all the agents we ever need.

- [ ] collaboration with humans
David thinks that the agents should collaborate with humans using a process stage approach like:
1. Human input
2. Trigger agent task
3. Agent response
4. Repeat
